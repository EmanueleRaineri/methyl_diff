\begin{letter}{The Editor, Plos One}
\opening{Dear Editor:}
I am writing to submit our manuscript entitled \emph{A note on exact differences between beta distributions in genomic (methylation) studies} for consideration for publication in Plos One.

In the paper we explain why exact computation of differences between beta distributions can be advantageous in genomic studies, taking the specific case of DNA methylation as a concrete example. Besides, we present a software which implements a known algorithm to perform the necessary computation starting from the counts of methylated and non methylated reads mapped over a given genomic position.

We are submitting our manuscript as a \emph{Software paper}. I don't have any strong preference for what regards the choice of an Academic Editor; anyone with an interest in statistics and genomics would be appropriate. A cursory look at the list provided on the Plos One website suggests that Mar√≠a Mar Abad-Grau could be a good choice. For what regards the reviewers, possibly Rafael Irizarry (rafa@jhu.edu) or Lior Pachter (lpachter@math.berkeley.edu) might be interested in having a look at our paper.

I hope you will view this submission favourably and wish you a happy new year.
\closing{Yours Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
